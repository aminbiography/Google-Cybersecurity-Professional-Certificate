# Network Protocol Analyzer - Wireshark & tcpdump

---

## 1. What is the difference between Wireshark and tcpdump?
**Answer:**

**Wireshark**:
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Deep packet inspection
- Ideal for detailed analysis and visual troubleshooting

**tcpdump**:
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Lightweight and scriptable
- Best for remote systems and quick captures

---

## 2. What is a packet capture (p-cap) file and how is it useful?
**Answer:**

A `p-cap` file stores captured network packets. It is useful for:
- Offline inspection
- Sharing with teams for investigation
- Forensic analysis and troubleshooting
- Replaying network behavior

---

## 3. What is packet sniffing, and is it legal?
**Answer:**

**Packet sniffing** is capturing and inspecting packets on a network.

**Legal** if done:
- On private networks
- With proper authorization

**Illegal** if done:
- Without consent
- On third-party/public networks

---

## 4. What are common use cases for tcpdump?
**Answer:**

- Real-time traffic monitoring
- Filtering traffic by port, IP, or protocol
- Saving packets to a file
- Network troubleshooting
- Detecting anomalies or malicious traffic

---

## 5. How do you capture only HTTP traffic using tcpdump?
**Answer:**

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
```

## 6. tcpdump Flags: `-v`, `-w`, `-r`, and `-n`
**Answer:**

|------|-------------------------------------|
| Flag | Description                         |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| `-v` | Verbose output                      |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| `-w` | Write packets to a file             |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| `-r` | Read from a `.pcap` file            |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| `-n` | No name resolution (IP/Port)        |
|------|-------------------------------------|

## 7. What is an IP Header and Why Is It Important?
**Answer:**

The IP header includes:

- **Source/Destination IP addresses**
- **TTL (Time To Live)**
- **Protocol information (TCP/UDP)**
- **Checksum for integrity validation**

**Used in investigations** to trace, analyze, and validate network traffic.

---

## 8. What is an Indicator of Compromise (IoC)?
**Answer:**

An **Indicator of Compromise (IoC)** is **evidence of malicious activity**, such as:

- Unusual IP addresses
- Unexpected ports in use
- Known malware file hashes
- Suspicious or flagged domains

---

## 9. What is the Significance of TTL (Time To Live)?
**Answer:**

**TTL** helps prevent **routing loops** by limiting the number of hops a packet can take.

TTL values can be used to:

- **Identify spoofed packets**
- **Perform OS fingerprinting** (based on default TTL values)

## 10. How Do `tcpdump` and `Wireshark` Support Incident Response?
**Answer:**

|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tool       | Role in Incident Response                                       |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tcpdump`  | Fast, remote, CLI-based packet capture                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wireshark  | Deep analysis with GUI and packet visualization                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Both**   | Assist with forensics, timeline creation, and malware detection |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

**Tip:** Use `tcpdump` for quick capture or automation.  
Use **Wireshark** for detailed investigation and visual packet analysis.
