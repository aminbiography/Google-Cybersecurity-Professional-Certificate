## Incident Response & Lifecycle

### 1: What are the phases of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle?
**Answer:**  
The NIST Incident Response Lifecycle has four phases:  
1. **Preparation**  
2. **Detection and Analysis**  
3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**  
4. **Post-Incident Activity**

### 2: What is the purpose of post-incident activity?
**Answer:**
Post-incident activity involves reviewing the incident to identify areas for improvement, conducting lessons learned meetings, and developing a **final report** with recommendations to prevent similar future incidents.

## Triage and Alert Handling

### 3: What are the steps involved in triaging a security alert?
**Answer:**
1. **Receive and assess** – Review alert details and determine if it's a false positive.  
2. **Assign priority** – Based on the impact, urgency, and scope of the incident.  
3. **Collect and analyze** – Gather logs and evidence for deeper investigation.

---

### 4: What factors determine the priority of an incident?
**Answer:**
- **Functional impact** (disruption to services)  
- **Information impact** (data exposure)  
- **Recoverability** (ease of restoration)

## Documentation & Reports

### Q5: Why is documentation important in cybersecurity?
**Answer:**
It provides **transparency**, **standardization**, and **clarity**, ensuring all actions are recorded, repeatable, and understandable for audits, legal needs, and team coordination.

---

### 6: What is included in a final incident report?
**Answer:**
- Executive summary  
- Detailed timeline  
- Investigation details  
- Response actions  
- Recommendations for future prevention

## Detection & Analysis

### 7: What are Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Indicators of Attack (IoAs)?
**Answer:**
- **IoCs** are artifacts like IPs, file hashes, or domain names that indicate past compromise.  
- **IoAs** reflect behaviors and patterns indicating an ongoing attack.

---

### 8: How do tools like VirusTotal help in incident response?
**Answer:**
VirusTotal analyzes files, URLs, and hashes to check if they're malicious. It provides reputation scores, behavior reports, and links to related IoCs, helping analysts validate alerts quickly.

## Containment, Eradication & Recovery

### Q9: Give examples of tasks under containment, eradication, and recovery.
**Answer:**
- **Containment**: Isolating infected systems  
- **Eradication**: Removing malware, patching vulnerabilities  
- **Recovery**: Reimaging systems, restoring data, resetting passwords

---

### 10: What is the difference between a business continuity plan (BCP) and a disaster recovery plan (DRP)?
**Answer:**
- **BCP** ensures critical business functions continue during disruptions.  
- **DRP** focuses on restoring IT systems after disasters like natural events or major system failures.
