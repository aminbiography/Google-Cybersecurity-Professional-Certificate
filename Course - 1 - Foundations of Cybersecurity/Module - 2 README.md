<h1>Cybersecurity History & Overview of CISSP Domains</h1>
<h3>Cybersecurity History: Key Milestones in Cybersecurity Evolution:</h3>
<p>The history of cybersecurity is shaped by key attacks and advancements that have driven the evolution of security practices and technologies. Two significant early attacks were the Brain virus (1986) and the Morris worm (1988), both of which impacted the security landscape and influenced the development of modern cybersecurity measures.</p>

<li><strong>The Brain Virus (1986):</strong> Created by the Alvi brothers to track pirated medical software, the Brain virus spread unintentionally by infecting disks used on a compromised machine. It highlighted the need for security planning and demonstrated how malware could disrupt business operations and spread rapidly across networks.</li>
<li><strong>The Morris Worm (1988):</strong> Developed to assess the size of the internet, the Morris worm infected approximately 6,000 computers, causing widespread system crashes and disrupting operations. It led to the establishment of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), which continue to play a crucial role in responding to cybersecurity incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Love Letter (2000):</strong> The "I Love You" virus spread via email, deceiving users with an affectionate message. It stole passwords and sent itself to all contacts, demonstrating the power of social engineering.</li>

<h3>As of 2022, CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) Domains</h3>
<p>The eight domains of CISSP that help organize the work of cybersecurity professionals include:</p>

<li><strong>Security and Risk Management:</strong> Governance, risk, compliance, and legal issues.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Security:</strong> Protection of digital and physical assets.</li>
<li><strong>Security Architecture and Engineering:</strong> Design principles, cryptography, and infrastructure security.</li>
<li><strong>Communication and Network Security:</strong> Protection of communication channels and networks.</li>
<li><strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong> Manages identity, authentication, and authorization.</li>
<li><strong>Security Assessment and Testing:</strong> Includes vulnerability assessments and audits.</li>
<li><strong>Security Operations:</strong> Incident response and monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development Security:</strong> Securing the software development lifecycle.</li>

<h3>Types of Attacks</h3>
<li><strong>Password Attacks:</strong> Brute force and rainbow table techniques to break passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Includes Phishing, Vishing, and Spear Phishing to exploit human error.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Attacks:</strong> Malicious USB devices and physical access exploits.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Social Engineering:</strong> Impersonating individuals to gain physical access.</li>
<li><strong>Malware:</strong> Includes viruses, worms, and other harmful software.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptographic Attacks:</strong> Attacking encryption algorithms or communications.</li>
<li><strong>Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> AI/ML techniques used for more sophisticated automated attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Supply-Chain Attacks:</strong> Targeting third-party vendors for malware deployment or data access.</li>

<h3>Threat Actor Types</h3>
<li><strong>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):</strong> Advanced, espionage-focused attackers.</li>
<li><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Trusted individuals exploiting their access.</li>
<li><strong>Hacktivists:</strong> Attackers with political or social motives.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Hackers (Authorized Hackers):</strong> Authorized professionals identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Malicious Hackers (Unauthorized Hackers):</strong> Unauthorized individuals exploiting systems for gain.</li>

<h3>Terms & Definitions</h3>
<li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to steal sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Voice-based phishing using phone calls to deceive victims.</li>
<li><strong>Virus:</strong> Malicious code attaching to programs/files, spreading across systems.</li>
<li><strong>Malware:</strong> Software designed to harm or exploit systems.</li>
<li><strong>Worm:</strong> Self-replicating malware spreading autonomously across networks.</li>
