<h1>Cybersecurity History and Overview of CISSP Domains</h1>
<h3>Cybersecurity History: Key Milestones in Security Evolution:</h3>
<p>The history of cybersecurity is shaped by key attacks and advancements that have driven the evolution of security practices and technologies. Two significant early attacks were the Brain virus (1986) and the Morris worm (1988), both of which impacted the security landscape and influenced the development of modern cybersecurity measures.</p>

<li><strong>The Brain Virus (1986):</strong> Created by the Alvi brothers to track pirated medical software, the Brain virus spread unintentionally by infecting disks used on a compromised machine. It highlighted the need for security planning and demonstrated how malware could disrupt business operations and spread rapidly across networks.</li>
<li><strong>The Morris Worm (1988):</strong> Developed to assess the size of the internet, the Morris worm infected approximately 6,000 computers, causing widespread system crashes and disrupting operations. It led to the establishment of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), which continue to play a crucial role in responding to cybersecurity incidents.</li>

<h3>As of 2022, CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) Domains</h3>
<p>The eight domains of CISSP that help organize the work of cybersecurity professionals include:</p>

<li><strong>Security and Risk Management:</strong> Covers security governance, risk management, compliance, business continuity, and legal issues.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Security:</strong> Focuses on protecting physical and digital assets, data classification, and privacy protection.</li>
<li><strong>Security Architecture and Engineering:</strong> Deals with secure design principles, cryptography, and infrastructure security.</li>
<li><strong>Communication and Network Security:</strong> Ensures the security of communication channels and network infrastructures.</li>
<li><strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong> Manages identity, authentication, authorization, and access control.</li>
<li><strong>Security Assessment and Testing:</strong> Includes vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and security audits.</li>
<li><strong>Security Operations:</strong> Covers incident response, monitoring, and handling day-to-day security operations.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development Security:</strong> Focuses on securing the software development lifecycle, from design to deployment.</li>

<h3>Types of Attacks</h3>
<li><strong>Password Attacks:</strong> Brute Force and Rainbow Table attacks attempt to break passwords to gain unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Exploits human error for malicious gain, including Phishing, Vishing, and Spear Phishing.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Attacks:</strong> Malicious USB devices and physical access exploits that compromise system security.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Social Engineering:</strong> A type of social engineering where attackers impersonate employees, customers, or vendors to gain unauthorized physical access.</li>
<li><strong>Malware:</strong> Includes viruses, worms, and other malicious software designed to harm systems.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptographic Attacks:</strong> Involve breaking encryption algorithms or attacking encrypted communications.</li>
<li><strong>Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> Uses AI/ML techniques to conduct more sophisticated and automated attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Supply-Chain Attacks:</strong> Target third-party vendors and partners to deploy malware or access data through vulnerabilities.</li>

<h3>Threat Actor Types</h3>
<li><strong>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):</strong> Sophisticated attackers who target large organizations, typically for espionage or infrastructure damage.</li>
<li><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Employees or trusted individuals who misuse their access for malicious purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Hacktivists:</strong> Attackers with political or social agendas who exploit systems for activism.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Hackers (Authorized Hackers):</strong> Use their skills to identify vulnerabilities and protect organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Malicious Hackers (Unauthorized Hackers):</strong> Use their skills to exploit systems for financial gain, data theft, or other malicious purposes.</li>

<h3>Terms & Definitions</h3>
<li><strong>Phishing:</strong> A type of social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Vishing:</strong> A form of phishing that uses voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to deceive victims into disclosing private information.</li>
<li><strong>Virus:</strong> Malicious code that attaches to programs/files and spreads to other systems.</li>
<li><strong>Malware:</strong> Software designed to harm or exploit devices, networks, or services.</li>
<li><strong>Worm:</strong> Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without user intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Hacking:</strong> Legally testing systems for vulnerabilities to improve security./li>
<li><strong>Malicious Hacking:</strong> Unauthorized hacking for personal or financial gain./li>
