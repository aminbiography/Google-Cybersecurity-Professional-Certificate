<h1>Cybersecurity Concepts & Skills</h1>

<h3>Cybersecurity Overview:</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or exploitation.</p>
<p>It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and is essential for the security of both digital and physical assets.</p>

<h3>Core Skills for Cybersecurity Analysts:</h3>

<h4>Transferable Skills:</h4>
<li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Ability to identify and mitigate risks or issues.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Effective written and verbal communication, especially in explaining complex issues to non-technical stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working with team members and stakeholders to manage security risks and incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Analytical Thinking:</strong> Ability to critically assess threats and vulnerabilities.</li>

<h4>Technical Skills:</h4>
<li><strong>Programming:</strong> Understanding languages like Python, SQL to automate tasks and support security operations.</li>
<li><strong>SIEM Tools:</strong> Security Information and Event Management tools for identifying and analyzing security threats.</li>
<li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> Procedures followed when a security breach occurs to minimize damage and restore operations.</li>

<h3>Security Analyst Responsibilities:</h3>
<li><strong>Protecting Computer and Network Systems:</strong> Implementing security protocols, systems, and software to protect against threats.</li>
<li><strong>Installing Prevention Software:</strong> Installing firewalls, anti-malware tools, and other security software to proactively protect against cyberattacks.</li>
<li><strong>Examining Security Issues:</strong> Identifying and investigating vulnerabilities in networks and systems to mitigate potential risks.</li>

<h3>Common Tools & Practices:</h3>
<li><strong>SIEM Tools:</strong> Used for reviewing logs, identifying vulnerabilities, and analyzing threats to systems and networks.</li>
<li><strong>Penetration Testing (Pen Test):</strong> A simulated cyberattack to find vulnerabilities within a system and fix them before a real attack happens.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Forensics:</strong> Investigating systems and networks to recover evidence, typically after a breach or cyberattack.</li>

<h3>Important Security Practices:</h3>
<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Ensuring the organization follows legal and industry-specific guidelines to avoid fines and maintain trust.</li>
<li><strong>Identity Theft Protection:</strong> Protecting sensitive data (PII/SPII) to prevent identity theft and fraud, which can have significant financial and personal consequences.</li>

<h3>Key Concepts for Cybersecurity Analysts:</h3>
<li><strong>Security Posture:</strong> An organization’s overall ability to defend critical data and assets and adapt to emerging threats.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Threats:</strong> Risks posed by insiders, often unintentionally, such as employees clicking on phishing links.</li>

<h3>Terms & Definitions:</h3>
<li><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Ensures that cloud-stored assets are securely configured and accessible only to authorized users.</li>
<li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Involves the protection of an organization’s network infrastructure from unauthorized access and cyberattacks.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Threat:</strong> Refers to security risks posed by current or former employees, vendors, or trusted partners who might misuse their access privileges.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Actor:</strong> An individual or group that poses a security risk, such as hackers, insiders, or other malicious entities.</li>
