<h1>Frameworks & Ethical Practices in Cybersecurity</h1>

<h3>Security Frameworks & Risk Management:</h3>
<li><strong>Purpose: </strong>Security frameworks provide guidelines and standards for protecting organizations from risks and aligning security with business goals. Frameworks like the <b>CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) are fundamental for assessing and mitigating risks.</b></li>
<li><strong>Core Components:</strong> Security goals, guidelines, security processes, and regulatory compliance measures help set up effective security architectures.</li>
<h3>Security Ethics & Legal Considerations</h3>
<li><strong>Ethical Principles:</strong> Always act with integrity, avoid conflicts of interest, and consider the consequences of your actions. Uphold the confidentiality of sensitive data and ensure systems remain secure.</li>
<li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Be prepared to discuss scenarios where ethical dilemmas arise (e.g., accessing data without proper authorization or handling data breaches). Focus on why ethical conduct in security is important.</li>
<h3>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</h3>
<p><strong>Core Components:</strong> The CSF helps organizations manage cybersecurity risk using a set of standards and best practices. It emphasizes the importance of assessment, detection, response, and recovery.</p>
<h3>Ethical Decision-Making Scenarios</h3>
<p><stron>Example:</strong> Handling a ransomware attack, responding to a colleagueâ€™s privacy violation, managing PII or SPII data securely, and how to ethically dispose of old equipment.</p>
<h3>Risk Management Frameworks (CIA Triad)</h3>
<p>Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: These three components guide how organizations assess risk, protect data, and prevent unauthorized access or misuse.</p>
<h3>Terms & Definitions:</h3>
<li><strong>Assets:</strong> Items of value to an organization, such as databases and sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong>Security Controls:</strong> Safeguards that help reduce security risks.</li>
<li><strong>Hacktivists:</strong> Individuals who use hacking for political or social activism.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity & Availability:</strong> Focus on ensuring data is correct, accessible, and protected.</li>
