# Incident Escalation in Cybersecurity

---

### **1: What is incident escalation, and why is it important in a security operations role?**

**Answer:**  
Incident escalation is the process of identifying a potential security incident, triaging it, and transferring it to a more experienced team member or relevant team. It’s important because it ensures that incidents are handled quickly and by the right personnel before they grow into serious threats.

### **2: Can you explain the difference between malware infection, unauthorized access, and improper usage?**

**Answer:** 
- **Malware infection** occurs when malicious software infiltrates an organization's system or network.  
- **Unauthorized access** is when someone gains digital or physical access to a system or data without permission.  
- **Improper usage** is when an employee violates acceptable use policies, like using work systems for personal activities.

### **3: How do you decide which incident to escalate first when multiple alerts occur at the same time?**

**Answer:**  
I prioritize based on the **criticality of the asset** involved and the **potential impact**. For example, if one alert involves a system storing PII and another is about unapproved software, the PII-related incident should be escalated first due to its higher risk to the organization.

### **4: What is an escalation policy, and what should you do if your direct supervisor is unavailable?**

**Answer:** 
An escalation policy outlines how and to whom incidents should be escalated. If my direct supervisor is unavailable, I would refer to the policy for the next point of contact to ensure no delay in escalation.

### **5: Why is attention to detail important for a cybersecurity analyst?**

**Answer:** 
Attention to detail helps analysts detect subtle signs of potential threats in logs and alerts. It also ensures they follow the correct escalation steps and avoid mistakes that could delay a response to a serious incident.

### **6: How do you ensure you're familiar with an organization’s escalation process when starting a new role?**

**Answer:** 
I review the escalation policy during onboarding, ask questions to clarify procedures, and save or bookmark the policy for easy access. This helps me act confidently and quickly when incidents arise.

### **7: What would you do if you saw 10 failed login attempts on an employee account?**

**Answer:** 
I would recognize this as a potential brute-force or unauthorized access attempt. According to most escalation policies, this should be escalated to the appropriate team, such as password protection or account security, for further investigation.

---

### **8: What should be your response if you’re unsure about whether an event needs to be escalated?**

**Answer:**  
If I’m unsure, I would still document the event, review the escalation policy, and consult with a supervisor or senior analyst. Asking questions shows initiative and helps ensure incidents aren’t missed or misjudged.

---

### **9: Describe a situation where improper usage might be accidental and how you would handle it.**

**Answer:** 
An employee might unknowingly install personal software on a work device. I would escalate the incident following policy, but also ensure it’s investigated with context—was it a misunderstanding, or intentional misuse?

---

### **10: Why is it important to escalate incidents involving PII with high urgency?**

**Answer:** 
PII-related incidents pose legal, financial, and reputational risks. Many regions have breach notification laws, and failing to act quickly can result in regulatory penalties and loss of customer trust.
