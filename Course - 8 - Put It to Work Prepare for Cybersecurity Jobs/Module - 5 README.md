# Technical, Behavioral, and AI Use for Aspiring Security Analysts

---

### Technical Questions

---

#### **1. What is the CIA Triad and why is it important in cybersecurity?**

**Answer:**  
The CIA Triad stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized individuals.  
- **Integrity**: Ensures data is accurate and unaltered.  
- **Availability**: Ensures systems and data are available when needed.  

It helps guide security policies and practices to protect systems effectively.

#### **2. What are common signs of a phishing email?**

**Answer:**  
- Urgent or threatening language  
- Suspicious links or attachments  
- Sender address mismatch  
- Grammar/spelling errors  
- Requests for sensitive information  

AI tools can help flag these, but user awareness is key.

#### **3. How would you respond to a suspected malware infection on a corporate device?**

**Answer:**
1. Isolate the device  
2. Notify the incident response team  
3. Analyze with endpoint tools  
4. Preserve evidence/logs  
5. Restore safely and review the incident

#### **4. What is NIST 800-53 and how do you use it?**

**Answer:**  
NIST SP 800-53 outlines **security and privacy controls** for federal systems. I use it to implement best practices and enhance non-federal systems' security posture based on recommended safeguards and enhancements.

### Behavioral & Situational (STAR Method)

---

#### **5. Tell me about a time you solved a challenging technical problem.**

**Answer (STAR):**  
- **S**: Tasked with running a scan with Nmap  
- **T**: Detected abnormal traffic but lacked insights  
- **A**: Used Wireshark for deeper analysis  
- **R**: Identified brute-force login attempts, reported to the team

---

#### **6. Describe a time you made a mistake. How did you handle it?**

**Answer (STAR):**  
- **S**: Changed wrong file permissions on Linux  
- **T**: Locked myself out of essential files  
- **A**: Fixed with `chmod 775`, created a checklist  
- **R**: Team adopted the checklist; mistake became a learning opportunity

---

#### **7. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest cybersecurity threats?**

**Answer:**  
I follow **NIST**, **OWASP**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and join security communities. I also use **Gemini/ChatGPT** to digest lengthy reports and summarize threats for faster understanding.

### AI & Tools in Cybersecurity

---

#### **8. How do you use AI in your cybersecurity work?**

**Answer:**  
- Analyze system vulnerabilities (e.g., NIST SI-5)  
- Debug Python scripts  
- Summarize long logs or reports  
- Prioritize incident alerts  
- Draft documentation  

Always use the **human-in-the-loop** approach to verify outputs.

---

#### **9. How can AI help with incident response?**

**Answer:**  
- Prioritize alerts  
- Detect anomalies  
- Recommend mitigation steps  
- Assist with documentation  

AI speeds things up, but decisions must be validated by humans.

---

#### **10. How would you educate non-technical staff about phishing threats?**

**Answer:**  
1. Create a **clear and visual guide**  
2. Use real-world examples  
3. Conduct simulations  
4. Reinforce awareness regularly  

I keep the language simple and relatable for all employees.
