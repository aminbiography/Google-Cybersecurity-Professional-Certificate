# Best Practices in Cybersecurity Analysis

## 1. What is a security mindset, and why is it important?
**Answer:**  
A security mindset is the ability to evaluate risks and continuously identify potential or actual breaches in systems, applications, or data. It's important because it helps security analysts proactively protect an organization’s assets, stay alert to evolving threats, and think critically about every action that could affect security.

## 2. How would you classify different types of data within an organization?
**Answer:**  
Data is generally classified into four main types:
- **Public data**: Openly available (e.g., press releases).
- **Private data**: Meant for internal use (e.g., employee ID numbers).
- **Sensitive data**: Includes PII, SPII, PHI (e.g., social security numbers, banking info).
- **Confidential data**: High-impact information (e.g., trade secrets, financial records).

Understanding these helps prioritize protection levels based on potential risks.

## 3. What steps would you follow when responding to a potential security incident?
**Answer:**
1. **Identify** the event and determine if it’s a true security incident.
2. **Assess** the potential impact (data involved, systems affected).
3. **Contain and escalate** the issue to the appropriate team.
4. **Document** the event and all actions taken.
5. **Analyze** and contribute to post-incident review to improve defenses.

## 4. Can you explain the difference between a security event and a security incident?
**Answer:**  
- A **security event** is any observable occurrence in a system or network.  
- A **security incident** is a confirmed event that results in a data breach or compromises data integrity, availability, or confidentiality.

## 5. What is the purpose of a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)?
**Answer:**  
- **BCP** ensures business operations continue during/after a disruption.  
- **DRP** focuses on restoring IT systems and data after a security incident.  
Both minimize the impact of disruptions and help maintain service and trust.

## 6. What are examples of low-level and high-level assets in cybersecurity?
**Answer:**  
- **Low-level assets**: Guest Wi-Fi networks, public websites, press releases.  
- **High-level assets**: Customer data, financial records, intellectual property, trade secrets.

## 7. Describe the Information Lifecycle Strategy and its importance.
**Answer:**  
It involves four steps:
1. **Identify** important assets (e.g., PII, financial info).
2. **Assess** security measures and vulnerabilities.
3. **Protect** assets through appropriate controls.
4. **Monitor** systems to ensure ongoing protection.  
It ensures data is handled securely throughout its lifecycle.

## 8. How would you handle an employee installing unauthorized software on their work device?
**Answer:**  
I would report the incident to my supervisor as it could introduce vulnerabilities. Unauthorized apps might carry malware or bypass security policies, so it’s important to address both the policy breach and any potential threat the app might introduce.

## 9. How do you stay current with emerging cybersecurity threats?
**Answer:**  
I stay updated by reading security blogs, subscribing to threat intelligence feeds, taking online courses, and following trusted sources like NIST, SANS Institute, and cybersecurity communities on platforms like LinkedIn or Reddit.

## 10. Why is protecting customer data so important for organizations?
**Answer:**  
Customer data is highly sensitive and valuable. Breaches can lead to financial loss, legal consequences, and damage to brand reputation. Customers trust companies to keep their data secure, and failing to do so can impact long-term business success.
