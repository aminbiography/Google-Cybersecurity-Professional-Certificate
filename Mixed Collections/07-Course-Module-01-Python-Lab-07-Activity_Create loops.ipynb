    "\n",
    "3. The break statement stops a loop when necessary, such as detecting an unauthorized IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The range() function simplifies iteration and can take variables as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using logical conditions inside loops can enhance automation, such as stopping when only 10 employee IDs remain.\n",
