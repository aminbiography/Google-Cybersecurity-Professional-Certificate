<h1>Threat, Risk, and Vulnerability Management</h1>
<h3>Layers of web</h3>
<li><strong>Surface Web:</strong> The publicly accessible part of the internet, indexed by search engines.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Web:</strong> Unindexed content not accessible via standard search engines, such as private databases, intranets, or logged-in data.</li>
<li><strong>Dark Web:</strong> A small portion of the deep web, accessible only through special tools like Tor, often associated with anonymous activities and illegal content.</li>
<h3>Levels of Risk</h3>
<li><strong>Low-risk asset:</strong> Minimal impact if compromised; no harm to reputation, operations, or finances.</li>
<li><strong>Medium-risk asset:</strong> Could cause some harm to reputation, operations, or finances if compromised.</li>
<li><strong>High-risk asset:</strong> Critical assets protected by regulations or laws (e.g., Intellectual Property, PII, SPII).</li>
<h3>Security Posture</h3>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> An organization’s ability to manage defense of critical assets and data and react to changes.</li>
<li><strong>Importance:</strong> A strong security posture is essential to adapt and respond effectively to new threats.</li>
<h3>Consequences of Security Breaches</h3>
<li><strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> Loss of trust and negative publicity.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Losses:</strong> Recovery costs, fines, or lost business.</li>
<h3>Types of Threats and Risks</h3>
<li><strong>External Threats:</strong> From outside the organization, such as hackers.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Threats:</strong> From current or former employees or trusted partners.</li>
<li><strong>Risks:</strong> Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.</li>
<h3>Risk Management Framework (RMF) Steps</h3>
<li><strong>Prepare:</strong> Activities to manage risks before an incident occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Categorize:</strong> Develop risk management processes and frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Select:</strong> Choose and document security controls.</li>
<li><strong>Implement:</strong> Apply the selected security measures.</li>
<li><strong>Assess:</strong> Determine if controls are effective.</li>
<li><strong>Authorize:</strong> Take responsibility for the organization’s security.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Continuously track system operations for ongoing security.</li>
<h3>Security Assessment and Testing Domain Key Areas</h3>
<li><strong>Collect and Analyze Data:</strong> Gathering data is crucial for identifying potential security issues.</li>
<li><strong>Perform Security Audits:</strong> Audits help evaluate the effectiveness of security measures.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct Security Control Testing:</strong> Ensures that security controls are functioning as intended.</li>
