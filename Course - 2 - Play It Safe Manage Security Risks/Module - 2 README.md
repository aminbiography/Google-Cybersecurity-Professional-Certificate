# Security Frameworks, Controls, and Compliance


## 1. Security Frameworks & Posture
- **Security Frameworks** (e.g., NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-53) are essential in developing an organization’s security posture. They provide guidance on managing cybersecurity risks, protecting critical data, and ensuring business continuity.
- Frameworks offer standards, guidelines, and best practices to help reduce risk, ensure compliance, and defend against cyber threats.

## 2. CIA Triad
The **CIA Triad** is foundational for cybersecurity:
- **Confidentiality** ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
- **Integrity** ensures that data is accurate, trustworthy, and has not been tampered with.
- **Availability** ensures that data is accessible to authorized users when needed.

## 3. Core Security Concepts
- **Authentication**: The process of verifying who a person is.
- **Authorization**: Granting access to resources based on permissions.
- **Biometrics** (e.g., fingerprints, palm scan, eye scan) are used for identity verification.
- **Encryption**: Protects data by converting it into an unreadable format.
- **Security Controls**: Safeguards (technical, physical, administrative) used to protect systems and data from threats.

## 4. Key Security Frameworks
- **NIST CSF**: A voluntary framework that helps organizations manage cybersecurity risks across five core functions:
  - **Identify**
  - **Protect**
  - **Detect**
  - **Respond**
  - **Recover**
- **OWASP Secure Design Principles**: Focus on simplicity (e.g., Keep security simple), implementing defense in depth, and applying the principle of least privilege.

## 5. Internal Security Audits
- An **Internal Security Audit** assesses an organization’s security policies, controls, and practices.
- The objectives of an audit include:
  - Identifying risks
  - Improving the security posture
  - Ensuring compliance to avoid penalties
- Audits may lead to recommendations like:
  - Implementing **physical controls** (e.g., surveillance cameras)
  - Improving security monitoring

## 6. Compliance and Risk
- **Compliance** with regulations like **PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, and **SOC standards** is crucial to avoid legal penalties and reputational damage.
- A **risk assessment** helps identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and determines the security measures to mitigate those risks.

## 7. Key Compliance Frameworks
- **PCI DSS**: Protects payment card information, mandates encryption, and secure password management.
- **GDPR**: Focuses on protecting EU customer data, ensuring proper data classification, and implementing notification procedures in case of a breach.

## 8. Security Audits & Reporting
- After an audit, key findings (e.g., risks, recommendations) are communicated to stakeholders.
- **Key outcomes** include:
  - Results and recommendations
  - A list of existing risks
  - A summary of the audit scope
