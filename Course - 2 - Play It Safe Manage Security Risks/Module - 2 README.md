# Security Frameworks, Controls, and Compliance


## Security Frameworks & Posture
- **Security Frameworks** (e.g., NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-53) are essential in developing an organization’s security posture. They provide guidance on managing cybersecurity risks, protecting critical data, and ensuring business continuity.
- Frameworks offer standards, guidelines, and best practices to help reduce risk, ensure compliance, and defend against cyber threats.

- Security frameworks like **NIST CSF** and **NIST SP 800-53** help organizations build a strong security posture by offering guidance on managing risks, protecting data, and ensuring continuity. They provide standards, guidelines, and best practices to reduce risks, ensure compliance, and defend against cyber threats.

## CIA Triad
The **CIA Triad** is foundational for cybersecurity:
- **Confidentiality** ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
- **Integrity** ensures that data is accurate, trustworthy, and has not been tampered with.
- **Availability** ensures that data is accessible to authorized users when needed.

## Core Security Concepts
- **Authentication**: The process of verifying who a person is.
- **Authorization**: Granting access to resources based on permissions.
- **Biometrics** (e.g., fingerprints, palm scan, eye scan) are used for identity verification.
- **Encryption**: Protects data by converting it into an unreadable format.
- **Security Controls**: Safeguards (technical, physical, administrative) used to protect systems and data from threats.

## Security Frameworks
- **NIST CSF**: A voluntary framework that helps organizations manage cybersecurity risks across five core functions:
  - **Identify**: NIST function for managing cybersecurity risk.
  - **Protect**: NIST function to implement security measures.
  - **Detect**: NIST function for identifying security incidents.
  - **Respond**: NIST function for managing security incidents.
  - **Recover** NIST function for restoring systems and operations after a security incident.
- **OWASP Secure Design Principles (Non-profit focused on software security)**: Focus on simplicity (e.g., Keep security simple), implementing defense in depth, and applying the principle of least privilege.

## Internal Security Audits
- An **Internal Security Audit** assesses an organization’s security policies, controls, and practices.
- The objectives of an audit include:
  - Identifying risks
  - Improving the security posture
  - Ensuring compliance to avoid penalties
- Audits may lead to recommendations like:
  - Implementing **physical controls** (e.g., surveillance cameras)
  - Improving security monitoring

## Compliance and Risk
- **Compliance** with regulations like **PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, and **SOC standards** is crucial to avoid legal penalties and reputational damage.
- A **risk assessment** helps identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and determines the security measures to mitigate those risks.

## Key Compliance Frameworks
- **PCI DSS**: Protects payment card information, mandates encryption, and secure password management.
- **GDPR**: Focuses on protecting EU customer data, ensuring proper data classification, and implementing notification procedures in case of a breach.

## Security Audits & Reporting
- After an audit, key findings (e.g., risks, recommendations) are communicated to stakeholders.
- **Key outcomes** include:
  - Results and recommendations
  - A list of existing risks
  - A summary of the audit scope
 
## Tools & Technologies
- **Encryption**: Protecting data by converting it into an unreadable format to ensure confidentiality and security.
- **Biometrics**: Using unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or eye scans, for authentication to verify identity.
- **Firewalls, IDS, Antivirus**: Tools used for protecting systems from unauthorized access, detecting intrusions, and preventing malware infections.
