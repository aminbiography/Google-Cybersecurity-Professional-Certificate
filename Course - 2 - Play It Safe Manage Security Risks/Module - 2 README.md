# Security Frameworks, Controls, and Compliance


## Security Frameworks & Posture
- **Security Frameworks:** A set of guidelines, standards, and best practices designed to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks, protect critical data, and maintain compliance. Examples include NIST CSF and NIST SP 800-53.
- **Security Posture:** The overall security status of an organization, determined by its ability to defend critical assets, identify potential threats, and react effectively to changing security needs.

## CIA Triad
The **CIA Triad** is foundational for cybersecurity:
- **Confidentiality** ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
- **Integrity** ensures that data is accurate, trustworthy, and has not been tampered with.
- **Availability** ensures that data is accessible to authorized users when needed.

## Core Security Concepts
- **Authentication**: The process of verifying who a person is.
- **Authorization**: Granting access to resources based on permissions.
- **Biometrics** (e.g., fingerprints, palm scan, eye scan) Physical characteristics for identity verification.
- **Encryption**: Protects data by converting it into an unreadable format.
- **Security Controls**: Safeguards (technical, physical, administrative) used to protect systems and data from threats.

## Security Frameworks
- **NIST CSF**: A voluntary framework that helps organizations manage cybersecurity risks, across five core functions:
  - **Identify**: NIST function for managing cybersecurity risk.
  - **Protect**: NIST function to implement security measures.
  - **Detect**: NIST function for identifying security incidents.
  - **Respond**: NIST function for managing security incidents.
  - **Recover** NIST function for restoring systems and operations after a security incident.
- **OWASP Secure Design Principles (Non-profit focused on software security)**: Focus on simplicity (e.g., Keep security simple), implementing defense in depth, and applying the principle of least privilege.

## Internal Security Audits
- An **Internal Security Audit** assesses an organization’s security policies, controls, and practices.
- The objectives of an audit include:
  - Identifying risks
  - Improving the security posture
  - Ensuring compliance to avoid penalties
- Audits may lead to recommendations like:
  - Implementing **physical controls** (e.g., surveillance cameras)
  - Improving security monitoring

## Compliance & Risk
- **Compliance** with regulations like **PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, and **SOC standards** is crucial to avoid legal penalties and reputational damage.
- A **risk assessment** helps identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and determines the security measures to mitigate those risks.

## Compliance Frameworks
- **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: Protects payment card information, mandates encryption, and secure password management.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Focuses on protecting EU customer data, ensuring proper data classification, and implementing notification procedures in case of a breach.
 - **SOC (System and Organization Controls) standards**: Assess controls in service organizations, focusing on security, confidentiality, and availability. Includes SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 reports for different compliance levels.

## Security Audits & Reporting
- After an audit, key findings (e.g., risks, recommendations) are communicated to stakeholders.
- **Key outcomes** include:
  - Results and recommendations
  - A list of existing risks
  - A summary of the audit scope
 
## Tools & Technologies
- **Encryption**: Protecting data by converting it into an unreadable format to ensure confidentiality and security.
- **Biometrics**: Using unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or eye scans, for authentication to verify identity.
- **Firewalls, IDS, Antivirus**: Tools used for protecting systems from unauthorized access, detecting intrusions, and preventing malware infections.

## Terms and Definitions

- **Asset**: Valuable items for an organization.
- **Threat**: Event that can harm assets.
- **Attack Vectors**: Pathways attackers use to breach security.
- **Risk**: Threats that impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
- **Security Audit**: Review of security policies and controls.
