# SIEM, Logs, Tools, and Incident Response in Cybersecurity

---

## SIEM & Log Management

### 1. What is a SIEM tool and why is it important?
**Answer:**  
A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool collects, analyzes, and correlates security data (like logs) from across an organization’s IT infrastructure. It helps detect threats in real time, investigate incidents, and maintain compliance.

---

### 2. What are common types of logs used in cybersecurity?
**Answer:**
- **Firewall logs:** Record incoming/outgoing traffic and connection attempts.  
- **Network logs:** Track devices entering or leaving the network and their interactions.  
- **Server logs:** Log events related to services, like login attempts, usernames, and passwords.

---

### 3. How do SIEM dashboards help security professionals?
**Answer:**  
They provide visual representations (charts, tables, timelines) of security data to help analysts monitor threats, analyze patterns, and prioritize response actions in real time.

---

### 4. What’s the difference between self-hosted, cloud-hosted, and hybrid SIEM tools?
**Answer:**
- **Self-hosted:** Managed on the organization’s own infrastructure.  
- **Cloud-hosted:** Managed by a third-party vendor, accessible online.  
- **Hybrid:** Combines both approaches for flexibility and data control.

### 5. Name two popular SIEM tools and describe them.
**Answer:**
- **Splunk:** Offers Enterprise (self-hosted) and Cloud versions for real-time monitoring and alerting.  
- **Chronicle (by Google):** A cloud-native tool designed for scalability and deep analysis of security data.

---

### 6. What types of dashboards are found in SIEM tools like Splunk and Chronicle?
**Answer:**
- **Security posture dashboard:** Real-time event monitoring  
- **Incident review dashboard:** Timeline of suspicious activity  
- **Risk analysis dashboard:** Evaluates risky behavior (e.g., logins at unusual times)  
- **IOC matches dashboard (Chronicle):** Flags domains/IPs tied to threats  
- **User sign-in overview:** Tracks unusual login patterns

## Open-source vs. Proprietary Tools

### 7. What’s the difference between open-source and proprietary cybersecurity tools?
**Answer:**
- **Open-source:** Free, customizable, and publicly maintained (e.g., Linux, Suricata).  
- **Proprietary:** Paid, owned by companies, with limited modification access (e.g., Splunk, Chronicle).

---

### 8. Are open-source tools safe to use in cybersecurity?
**Answer:**  
Yes. While they can be targeted by threat actors, their open nature allows community-driven quick fixes, making them more secure when maintained properly.

## Incident Response & Threat Management

### 9. What is incident response in cybersecurity?
**Answer:**  
It's the process of quickly identifying, containing, and mitigating a security breach or threat to minimize damage and restore normal operations.

---

### 10. What is SOAR and how does it relate to SIEM?
**Answer:**  
SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) is a set of tools that automate responses to security events. It often integrates with SIEM to reduce manual intervention and improve response time.

---

### 11. What are metrics in a cybersecurity context?
**Answer:**  
Metrics are key technical attributes such as response time, availability, and failure rate used to assess system or software performance.

---

## Behavioral & Scenario-Based

### 12. How would you handle multiple login attempts from different locations in a short time?
**Answer:**  
I would investigate using a SIEM dashboard (e.g., incident review or user sign-in overview), check the IPs, device IDs, and timestamps, and if confirmed as suspicious, escalate or isolate the account while applying incident response protocols.

---

### 13. Do you need to know how to code to work in cybersecurity?
**Answer:**  
No, it's not required for all roles. While coding knowledge can be helpful, many roles focus on analysis, communication, investigation, and using tools effectively.
