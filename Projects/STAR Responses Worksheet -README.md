# STAR Interview Response Table

| **Question** | **STAR Element** | **Response** |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Q1: Describe an experience in which you implemented a security solution.** | **Situation** | During my role as an SEO Web Developer at Idol Wave, I discovered that a client’s website was vulnerable to data breaches due to the lack of SSL certification. This posed a significant security risk, especially for sites handling sensitive customer data. |
|              | **Task** | My responsibility was to implement a secure solution to protect user data by enabling SSL encryption across the website, ensuring that information was transmitted securely between users and the server. |
|              | **Action** | I conducted a thorough analysis of the website’s security architecture, identified areas lacking encryption, and applied SSL certificates. I configured the server to enforce HTTPS, tested the certificates with SSL Labs and Wireshark, and documented the process. |
|              | **Result** | The SSL implementation secured all data transmissions, improved user trust, and led to a 20% traffic increase the following quarter. The client provided positive feedback and avoided potential regulatory penalties. |

| **Q2: Describe an experience in which you used technical security tools as part of issue resolution.** | **Situation** | While working as an SEO Web Developer, I noticed unusual traffic patterns on a client’s website, indicating a possible DDoS attack that was affecting performance and availability. |
|              | **Task** | I needed to quickly identify and mitigate the threat to restore normal site operations. |
|              | **Action** | I used Wireshark to monitor live traffic and identified suspicious IP addresses. I verified abnormal activity using Splunk, implemented IP filtering, and configured a Web Application Firewall (WAF). I recorded the event in a security journal. |
|              | **Result** | The website’s performance was restored within hours. The client praised the rapid response and thorough documentation. The preventative measures also helped reduce future attack risk by 30%. |
