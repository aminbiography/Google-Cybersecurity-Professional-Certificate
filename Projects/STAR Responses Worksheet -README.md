## Question 1: Describe an experience in which you implemented a security solution.  
**What was your solution, how did you help with implementation, and what were the results?**

| **STAR Element** | **Response** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Situation** | During my role as an SEO Web Developer at Idol Wave, I discovered that a client’s website was vulnerable to data breaches due to the lack of SSL certification. This posed a significant security risk, especially for sites handling sensitive customer data. |
| **Task** | My responsibility was to implement a secure solution to protect user data by enabling SSL encryption across the website, ensuring that information was transmitted securely between users and the server. |
| **Action** | I conducted a thorough analysis of the website’s security architecture, identified areas lacking encryption, and applied SSL certificates. I configured the server to enforce HTTPS, tested the certificates with SSL Labs and Wireshark, and documented the process. |
| **Result** | The SSL implementation secured all data transmissions, improved user trust, and led to a 20% traffic increase the following quarter. The client provided positive feedback and avoided potential regulatory penalties. |

## Question 2: Describe an experience in which you used technical security tools as part of issue resolution.  
**How did you assess the issues and reach the conclusion that these tools represented the optimal solution? What was the outcome?**

| **STAR Element** | **Response** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Situation** | While working as an SEO Web Developer, I identified unusual traffic patterns on a client’s website, indicating a potential DDoS attack that was affecting website performance and availability. |
| **Task** | My responsibility was to quickly identify the source of the attack, assess the threat, and mitigate the issue to restore normal website operations. |
| **Action** | I used Wireshark to monitor incoming traffic and identified several suspicious IP addresses. I cross-referenced the logs with Splunk to detect abnormal patterns and pinpoint the origin of the attack. I then applied IP filtering and configured a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic. |
| **Result** | The website’s performance returned to normal within a few hours. My documentation and quick action were praised by the client, and the preventative measures I implemented reduced the chance of future attacks by 30%. |
