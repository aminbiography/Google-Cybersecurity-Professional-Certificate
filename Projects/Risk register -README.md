## Key Takeaways

- **High-priority risks (score 9):** Database compromise and financial record leaks must be mitigated immediately.
- **Moderate-priority (4–6):** Phishing exposure and supply chain vulnerabilities require strong controls.
- **Low-priority (≤3):** Theft is less likely but still critical due to its severity if it occurs.
- **Environmental factors** (e.g., hurricanes) and **employee access control** are recurring concerns.

## Recommendations

- Enforce strong encryption for all customer data.
- Conduct regular phishing simulations and employee training.
- Audit access to backup servers; remove public access immediately.
- Improve physical security protocols (e.g., safe checks).
- Develop disaster recovery plans addressing supply chain disruptions.
