## Recommendations (Optional)

- **Implement Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)** to enforce least privilege and restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Establish and test a Disaster Recovery Plan** to ensure resilience in the event of a cyber incident or natural disaster.
- **Enable Data Encryption** both at rest and in transit to protect credit card data and personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Deploy IDS and Antivirus Tools** to detect and respond to threats more effectively.
- **Adopt GDPR-compliant procedures** such as breach notification workflows and robust data classification.
- **Ensure SOC compliance** through regular audits of data availability, confidentiality, and integrity.
