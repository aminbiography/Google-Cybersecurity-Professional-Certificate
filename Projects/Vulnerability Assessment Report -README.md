# Vulnerability Assessment Report  
**Date:** 1st January 20XX  

---

## System Description  
The database server is powered by a high-performance CPU and **128GB of memory**, running the **latest Linux operating system**. It hosts a **MySQL** database and maintains communication over a stable **IPv4 network**. All server interactions are protected with **SSL/TLS-encrypted connections** for secure data transmission.

---

## Scope  
This vulnerability assessment focuses on the **access controls** of the database system.  
- **Assessment Period:** June 20XX – August 20XX  
- **Framework Used:** *NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1* (Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments)

---

## Purpose  
### Why is the database server valuable?  
The server stores **critical customer and transaction data** essential for the **e-commerce platform** to operate, supporting real-time business activities and strategic decision-making.

### Why is securing the server important?  
Securing the data ensures:  
- **Customer privacy and trust**  
- **Regulatory compliance**  
- **Defense against data breaches**, financial losses, and reputational harm

### What happens if the server is disabled?  
A disabled server could cause:  
- **Disruption in operations**  
- **Lost sales** and **downtime**  
- **Customer dissatisfaction**  
- **Damage to brand reputation** and **financial losses**

## Risk Assessment  

| **Threat Source**     | **Threat Event**                            | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Risk Score** |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Competitor             | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 1              | 3            | 3              |
| Hacker / Outsider      | Conduct denial of service (DoS) attacks       | 2              | 3            | 6              |
| Privileged User        | Alter or delete critical information          | 2              | 2            | 4              |

> **Note:** Risk score = Likelihood × Severity

---

## Approach  
The assessment evaluated risks related to **data storage** and **management practices**, balancing threat likelihood and severity with **operational continuity** requirements.

---

## Remediation Strategy  
To reduce identified risks, implement the following:

- **Authentication and Authorization Controls**  
  - Enforce **strong passwords**  
  - Enable **role-based access control (RBAC)**  
  - Require **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**  

- **Auditing**  
  - Monitor and log user activity to detect unauthorized access or anomalies

- **Network Security**  
  - Replace **SSL with TLS** for encrypted communications  
  - Implement **IP allow-listing** to restrict access to corporate networks only

---

By enforcing these controls, the organization strengthens its ability to **protect sensitive data**, prevent **insider threats**, and defend against **external cyberattacks**.
