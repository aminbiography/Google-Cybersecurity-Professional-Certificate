# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities in Cybersecurity

## 1. What are the three key elements of a security plan?

**Answer:**

- **Policies** – Strategic rules that guide behavior and reduce risk  
- **Standards** – Tactical references used to support policy development  
- **Procedures** – Step-by-step instructions to carry out specific security tasks  

---

## 2. What is asset classification and why is it important?

**Answer:**  
Asset classification is the practice of labeling assets based on their **sensitivity and importance** to an organization. It helps prioritize protection efforts and manage risks effectively, ensuring that critical or restricted data is more tightly controlled.

---

## 3. How would you explain the difference between a threat, vulnerability, and risk?

**Answer:**

- **Threat** – Any event or actor that can cause harm (e.g., a hacker or malware)  
- **Vulnerability** – A weakness that could be exploited (e.g., weak passwords)  
- **Risk** – The potential impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, usually evaluated by *Likelihood × Severity*

## 4. What are the three states of data, and how do you secure each?

**Answer:**

- **Data at rest** – Stored data (e.g., on a hard drive). Use encryption and access controls.  
- **Data in transit** – Data moving over a network. Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, VPN).  
- **Data in use** – Data actively accessed. Use endpoint protection and secure applications.

## 5. What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and why is it useful?

**Answer:**  
The **NIST CSF** is a voluntary framework made up of best practices, standards, and guidelines to manage cybersecurity risk. It’s widely adopted because it’s **flexible**, **industry-agnostic**, and aligns with **compliance requirements**. It helps organizations **Identify**, **Protect**, **Detect**, **Respond**, and **Recover** from cyber threats.

## 6. What is the purpose of a risk register in cybersecurity?

**Answer:**  
A **risk register** is a tool used to log, track, and prioritize risks to an organization’s systems, data, or operations. It includes details like the risk’s **likelihood**, **severity**, and **overall priority** to help guide mitigation efforts.

---

## 7. Can you provide examples of restricted information?

**Answer:**

- **Intellectual property** (e.g., trade secrets)  
- **Cardholder data** (e.g., credit card numbers)  
- **Health information** (e.g., protected under HIPAA)

---

## 8. How does asset inventory support cybersecurity efforts?

**Answer:**  
An **asset inventory** is a complete list of organizational assets. It helps in:

- Identifying which assets need protection  
- Assigning responsibility and ownership  
- Supporting risk assessments and compliance efforts  
- Ensuring proper prioritization of security resources  

---

## 9. What is the shared responsibility model in cloud security?

**Answer:**  
The **shared responsibility model** means security duties are split between the **cloud provider** and the **customer**.  
For example, in **PaaS**, the provider secures the **infrastructure**, while the customer secures the **applications and data**.

---

## 10. How would you handle a misconfigured firewall discovered during an audit?

**Answer:**

1. Treat the misconfiguration as a **vulnerability**
2. Assess the **risk** (likelihood × severity)
3. **Document** the issue
4. **Implement a fix** (e.g., correct firewall rules)
5. **Verify** the correction
6. **Update** security procedures to prevent recurrence

---

## 11. What is compliance, and why is it important in cybersecurity?

**Answer:**  
**Compliance** ensures that organizations follow **internal policies** and **external regulations** (like HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS). It helps avoid legal issues and builds **trust** with customers and partners.

---

## 12. What is a policy vs. a regulation?

**Answer:**

- **Policy** – An internal rule set by the organization  
- **Regulation** – A legally binding rule from an external authority (e.g., government, industry body)

---

## 13. What does "least privilege" mean in access management?

**Answer:**  
It means users are given **only the access they need** to do their job—nothing more. It reduces the chance of **accidental** or **malicious misuse** of sensitive data.

---

## 14. What are some examples of common human vulnerabilities?

**Answer:**

- Weak or reused passwords  
- Falling for phishing emails  
- Sharing confidential info in unsecured ways

---

## 15. How would you explain the CIA triad?

**Answer:**

- **Confidentiality** – Ensuring only authorized users can access data  
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered  
- **Availability** – Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed
