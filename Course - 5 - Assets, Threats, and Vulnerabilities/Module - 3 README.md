## 1. What is the difference between a vulnerability, a threat, and an exploit?
**Anser:**
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system that can be exploited.
- **Threat**: A potential danger that targets a vulnerability.
- **Exploit**: The actual method or code used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

---

## 2. What is an attack surface and how is it different from an attack vector?
**Anser:**
- **Attack Surface**: All possible points where an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Attack Vector**: The specific pathway or method an attacker uses (e.g., phishing, USB, login forms).

---

## 3. What are the steps of the vulnerability management process?
**Anser:**
1. **Identify** vulnerabilities  
2. **Analyze** vulnerabilities  
3. **Assess risk**  
4. **Remediate** vulnerabilities  
5. **Monitor** and reassess

---

## 4. What is the defense in depth model and why is it used?
**Anser:**
The **defense in depth** model is a layered security strategy where multiple layers of defense reduce overall risk.
**Anser:**
- Helps **contain threats** even if one layer is breached
- **Addresses multiple vulnerabilities** at different levels

---

## 5. What is the CVEÂ® list and how is it useful?
**Anser:**
The **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** list is a public catalog of known security vulnerabilities.

- Standardizes vulnerability naming
- Helps organizations **identify known issues**
- Uses **CVSS scores** to prioritize risk

---

## 6. What is the purpose of a vulnerability assessment?
**Anser:**
A **vulnerability assessment** is an internal review to identify, categorize, and prioritize weaknesses that may be exploited by attackers.

---

## 7. What does it mean to adopt an attacker mindset?
**Anser:**
- Think like a hacker
- Identify a target
- Determine how the target can be accessed
- Evaluate attack vectors
- Find tools and methods of attack

This helps in building **more resilient defenses**.

---

## 8. What is a brute force attack and how can it be prevented?
**Anser:**
A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method to guess credentials.

### Prevention Measures:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **CAPTCHA**
- **Strong password policies**
- **Password hashing and salting**
- **Account lockout policies**

---

## 9. What is penetration testing and how is it different from a vulnerability assessment?
**Anser:**
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Finds weaknesses  
- **Penetration Test (Pen Test)**: Actively exploits those weaknesses to evaluate real-world impact

Pen tests simulate real attacks using **red**, **blue**, or **purple** team strategies.

## 10. How can a USB device be a security risk and how should it be handled?
**Anser:**
### Risks:
- Can deliver malware via **USB baiting**
- Can leak **PII or sensitive work data**

### Mitigations:
- Disable **AutoPlay**
- Use **virtual environments** to test unknown USBs
- Conduct **employee training**
- Use **USB port restrictions**

---

## 11. What are some examples of security hardening?
**Anser:**
- Apply patches and updates regularly
- Disable unused ports and services
- Enforce **least privilege access**
- Remove default credentials
- Use secure system configurations

---

## 12. What are the two main types of attack surfaces?
**Anser:**
- **Physical Attack Surface**: Devices, hardware, human access
- **Digital Attack Surface**: Networks, cloud systems, websites, software
