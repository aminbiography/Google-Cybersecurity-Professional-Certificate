# Cybersecurity Tools & Frameworks

## GENERAL CYBERSECURITY CONCEPTS

### 1: What is the CIA Triad in cybersecurity?
**Answer:** The CIA Triad stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**. It is a foundational model used to guide security policies:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensures that only authorized users can access data.  
- **Integrity:** Ensures that data is accurate and unaltered.  
- **Availability:** Ensures that data is accessible to authorized users when needed.

### 2: What is a security playbook, and why is it important?
**Answer:** A **playbook** is a manual that outlines step-by-step actions to respond to security incidents. It ensures **consistency, efficiency, and compliance** in handling threats and vulnerabilities. Playbooks are **living documents**, regularly updated based on past incidents and evolving threats.

---

### 3: What is a SIEM tool and how does it help in cybersecurity?
**Answer:** A **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tool collects, analyzes, and monitors log data in real-time to detect potential security threats. It helps in identifying suspicious activity and generating alerts for the security team to respond to.

---

### 4: What are SOAR tools, and how do they differ from SIEM?
**Answer:** **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** tools automate repetitive tasks triggered by SIEM alerts. While **SIEM identifies and logs threats**, **SOAR helps execute the response efficiently**, often with minimal human input.

---

### 11: What is the principle of least privilege?
**Answer:** The **principle of least privilege** means giving users and systems the minimum level of access or permissions they need to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious damage.

---

### 12: What is multi-factor authentication (MFA) and why is it important?
**Answer:** **MFA** requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system (e.g., password + code from a phone). It adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password.

## INCIDENT RESPONSE & THREAT HANDLING

### 5: What are the six phases of an incident response playbook?
**Answer:**

1. Preparation  
2. Detection and Analysis  
3. Containment  
4. Eradication and Recovery  
5. Post-Incident Activity  
6. Coordination

---

### 6: What should you do when you receive a suspicious alert from a SIEM tool?
**Answer:**

1. **Assess the alert** by reviewing logs and related metrics to verify its validity.  
2. If valid, **contain the threat** (e.g., isolate systems).  
3. **Eliminate traces** and **restore systems** using clean backups.  
4. **Document and report** the incident during the post-incident phase.

---

### 7: What’s the difference between a threat, vulnerability, and risk?
**Answer:**

- **Threat:** A potential event that can cause harm.  
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that can be exploited.  
- **Risk:** The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, causing damage.

---

### 13: What is the difference between detection and response in cybersecurity?
**Answer:**
- **Detection** involves identifying suspicious or malicious activity (e.g., via logs or alerts).
- **Response** involves taking steps to investigate, contain, and remediate the threat once it's detected.

## TOOLS & FRAMEWORKS

### 8: What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?
**Answer:** The **NIST CSF** is a voluntary framework that provides guidelines for managing cybersecurity risks. Its core functions are:

1. Identify  
2. Protect  
3. Detect  
4. Respond  
5. Recover

---

### 9: What is the role of log data in cybersecurity?
**Answer:** **Log data** records system and user activity. It is crucial for **detecting anomalies, investigating incidents, and conducting audits**. Tools like **Splunk** and **Chronicle** are commonly used to analyze log data.

---

### 14: What is encryption and how does it work?
**Answer:** **Encryption** is the process of converting readable data into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access. Only those with the correct **key** can decrypt and access the original information.

---

### 15: What is social engineering?
**Answer:** **Social engineering** is a manipulation technique used by attackers to trick people into giving up confidential information, often through phishing emails, fake calls, or misleading messages.

---

## SOFT SKILLS & TEAMWORK

### 10: Why is diversity of perspective important in cybersecurity?
**Answer:** A **diverse team** brings varied experiences and insights, helping to design more secure, inclusive, and user-centered solutions. Different backgrounds contribute to identifying and mitigating risks that may otherwise be overlooked.

---

### 16: Why are soft skills important in cybersecurity?
**Answer:** Communication, collaboration, and adaptability are critical in cybersecurity. Security professionals must clearly explain technical risks, coordinate during incident responses, and work across teams to ensure strong security practices.
