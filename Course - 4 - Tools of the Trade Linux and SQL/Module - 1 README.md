<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
<h4>OS: The interface between hardware and users, enabling task execution.</h4>
<p>Types of OS/Common OS include: 
  <li>Windows (Released 1985, closed source)</li> 
  <li>Linux (Released 1991, fully open source)</li> 
  <li>macOS (Released 1984, partially open source)</li> 
  <li>ChromeOS (Released 2011, partially open source),
    <br>
    
    - Chromium OS (Fully open source)</li> 
  <li>Android (Released 2008, fully open source)</li> 
  <li>iOS (Released 2007, partially open source)</li>
</p>
<h4><strong>Functions:</strong> OS manages memory, storage, input/output, and ensures efficient task execution.</h4>

<h4>User Interfaces: A program that allows the user to control the functions of the operating system.</h4>
<li><strong>GUI (Graphical User Interface):</strong> A user interface that uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the 
computer.</li>
<li><strong>CLI (Command-line Interface):</strong> A text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer.</li>

<h3>Virtualization</h3>
<li><strong>Virtual Machine (VM):</strong> A software-based version of a physical computer, enabling multiple OS environments on a single machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor:</strong> A tool for managing VMs, allocating physical resources to virtual systems.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits in Cybersecurity:</strong> Virtual machines provide secure environments for testing and analysis, helping isolate and investigate threats.</li>

<h3>Terms & Definitions</h3>
<li><strong>Application:</strong> A program that performs a specific task</li>
<li><strong>Basic Input/Output System (BIOS):</strong> A microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and is 
prevalent in older systems</li>
<li><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM):</strong> A hardware component used for short-term memory</li>
<li><strong>Bootloader:</strong> A software program that boots the operating system</li>
<li><strong>Legacy operating system:</strong> An operating system that is outdated but still being used</li>
