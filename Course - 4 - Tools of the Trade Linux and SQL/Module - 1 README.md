<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
<h4>OS: The interface between hardware and users, enabling task execution.</h4>
<p>Types of OS/Common OS include: 
  <li>Windows (1985, closed source)</li> 
  <li>Linux (1991, fully open source)</li> 
  <li>macOS (1984, partially open source)</li> 
  <li>ChromeOS (2011, partially open source), Chromium OS (Fully open source)</li> 
  <li>Android (2008, fully open source)</li> 
  <li>iOS (2007, partially open source)</li>
</p>
<h4><strong>Functions:</strong> OS manages memory, storage, input/output, and ensures efficient task execution.</h4>

<h3>User Interfaces: A program that allows the user to control the functions of the operating system.</h3>
<li><strong>GUI (Graphical User Interface):</strong> A user interface that uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the 
computer.</li>
<li><strong>CLI (Command-line Interface):</strong> A text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer.</li>

<h3>Virtualization</h3>
<li><strong>Virtual Machine (VM):</strong> A software-based version of a physical computer, enabling multiple OS environments on a single machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor:</strong> A tool for managing VMs, allocating physical resources to virtual systems.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits in Cybersecurity:</strong> Virtual machines provide secure environments for testing and analysis, helping isolate and investigate threats.</li>
