<h1>Linux Architecture & Shell Commands</h1>

<h3>Linux OS:</h3> An open-source, multi-user operating system widely used in cybersecurity. It supports various distributions (distros), each catering to different needs. Common security-related distributions include:

<li><strong>Kali Linux:</strong> Pre-installed with a variety of tools for penetration testing and digital forensics.</li>
<li><strong>Parrot OS:</strong> A security-focused distribution that includes tools for ethical hacking and privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Ubuntu:</strong> A user-friendly, general-purpose distribution with strong community support.</li>

<h3>Linux Shell:</h3> A command-line interpreter (CLI) that acts as a bridge between the user and the operating system. Common shells include:
<li><strong>Bash:</strong> The default shell in most Linux distributions and commonly used in cybersecurity. It enables you to execute commands and automate tasks.</li>

<h3>Standard Input (stdin), Output (stdout), and Error (stderr):</h3> 
<li><strong>Standard Input (stdin):</strong> Data entered by the user (e.g., typing commands).</li>
<li><strong>Standard Output (stdout):</strong> The result returned by the system after executing commands (e.g., command outputs).</li>
<li><strong>Standard Error (stderr):</strong> Error messages when commands fail (e.g., due to wrong syntax or insufficient permissions).</li>

<h3>Core Linux Commands:</h3>
<li><strong>echo:</strong> Used to output text to the terminal.</li>
<li><strong>nano:</strong> A simple text editor for creating and editing files in the terminal.</li>
<li><strong>expr:</strong> Performs basic arithmetic operations.</li>
<li><strong>clear:</strong> Clears the terminal screen.</li>

<h3>The Kernel:</h3> The central part of the OS that manages processes, memory, and hardware communication.
<li><b>Kernel:</b> Manages system resources and hardware communication, vital for system stability and security.</li>
<h3>File System:</h3> Organizes files and directories. The <b>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)</b> defines the directory structure and their content.
<li><b>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):</b> Defines the directory structure and file locations on Linux systems.</li>

<h3>Terms & Definitions</h3>
<li><b>Package Manager:</b> A tool used to install, update, and manage software packages on Linux (e.g., apt, yum, dpkg).</li>
<li><b>Penetration Testing (Pen Test):</b> A simulated cyberattack on a system to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><b>Digital Forensics:</b> The process of investigating a system for evidence, often after a cyberattack.</li>
