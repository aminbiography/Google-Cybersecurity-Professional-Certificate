<h1>Network Fundamentals and Protocols</h1>
<h3>Network Components</h3>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> A group of connected devices that communicate with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Modem:</strong> Connects your router to the internet, enabling internet access for your network.</li>
<li><strong>Switch:</strong> A device that connects specific devices within a local network and sends/receives data between them.</li>
<li><strong>Router:</strong> Connects different networks, routing data between them.</li>
<li><strong>Hub:</strong> A basic network device that broadcasts information to all devices within a network.</li>
<h3>Firewall</h3>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Protects networks by monitoring and controlling traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Placement:</strong> Positioned between trusted (internal) and untrusted (external) networks; operates at OSI Layers 3 (Network) and 4 (Transport), sometimes extending to Layer 7 (Application).</li>
<li><strong>Types:</strong> <b>Hardware Firewall:</b> Physical devices. <b>Software Firewall:</b> Installed on individual devices.</li>
<li><strong>Functions:</strong> Blocks unauthorized access; Filters traffic by IP, port, or protocol; Protects against malware and cyber threats.</li>
<h3>Types of Networks</h3>
<li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Covers small geographic areas like offices, homes, or schools.</li>
<li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> Spans large areas, such as cities, states, or countries.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing:</strong> Utilizes remote servers and services hosted on the internet instead of local physical infrastructure.</li>
<h3>Cloud Computing & Security</h3>
<li><strong>Cloud Service Providers (CSPs):</strong> Offer scalable, on-demand services like storage and computing.</li>
<li><strong>MAC (Media Access Control) Address:</strong> Unique identifier for devices, used by switches to route data.</li>
<h3>IP Addresses</h3>
<li><strong>IPv4:</strong> Uses a 32-bit address format (e.g., 192.168.0.1). Can address up to 4.3 billion devices.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6:</strong> Uses a 128-bit address format, allowing a vast number of addresses (e.g., 2002:0db8::ff21:0023:1234).</li>
<h3>TCP/IP Model</h3>
<p>A framework used to understand network communication, focusing on practical application.</p>
<p>Four Layers:</p>
<li><strong>Layer 4: Application:</strong> Handles high-level protocols like HTTP, FTP.</li>
<li><strong>Layer 3: Transport:</strong> Manages end-to-end communication; TCP (reliable) and UDP (unreliable).</li>
<li><strong>Layer 2: Internet:</strong> Deals with IP addressing and routing (IPv4, IPv6).</li>
<li><strong>Layer 1: Network Access:</strong> Defines how data is transmitted over physical media.</li>
<h3>OSI Model</h3>
<p>A conceptual framework with 7 layers to describe network communication.</p>
<p>Seven Layers:</p>
<li><strong>Layer 7: Application:</strong> User interface (HTTP, FTP).</li>
<li><strong>Layer 6: Presentation:</strong> Data formatting (encryption, compression).</li>
<li><strong>Layer 5: Session:</strong> Manages communication sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Layer 4: Transport:</strong> End-to-end communication (TCP, UDP).</li>
<li><strong>Layer 2: Data Link:</strong> Frame transmission over physical media.</li>
<li><strong>Layer 1: Physical:</strong> Physical transmission of data (cables, switches).</li>
<h3>Terms & Definitions:</h3>
<li><strong>IP (Internet Protocol):</strong> Routes and addresses data packets across networks.</li>
<li><strong>ISP (Internet Service Provider):</strong> A company that provides internet access to individuals and businesses.</li>
<li><strong>ITCP (Transmission Control Protocol):</strong> Ensures reliable, in-order delivery of data.</li>
<li><strong>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model:</strong> A 7-layer framework for network communication and troubleshooting.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong> Transfers web pages over the internet. (Port 80).</li>
<li><strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</strong> Transfers files between computers securely. (Port 20, 21).</li>
<li><strong>SSH (Secure Shell):</strong> Secure remote access (Port 22).</li>
<li><strong>Protocol Numbers:</strong> Indicate the type of protocol used for data transmission (e.g., HTTP, FTP).</li>
<li><strong>Ports:</strong> Logical channels for communication (e.g., HTTPS – Port 443).</li>
